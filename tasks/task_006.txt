# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Model Saving Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable saving and loading trained models.
# Details:
Implement functions to save the model state and optimizer state. Support saving in PyTorch format and provide options for exporting to ONNX.

# Test Strategy:
Save a model after training and verify it can be loaded and used for inference.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Saving model state [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to save the model's state (weights, architecture, etc.) in a compatible format.
### Details:
Ensure the saved state includes all necessary components for reloading the model correctly, such as layer weights and configurations.
<info added on 2025-05-10T02:51:14.890Z>
Implementation completed with the following features:
1. Added methods to VisionTransformer class: save_model(), load_model(), save_weights(), load_weights(), export_to_onnx()
2. Created model_utils.py module with general model saving/loading functions: save_model(), load_model(), export_to_onnx(), save_checkpoint(), load_checkpoint(), get_model_info()
3. Updated TrainingLoop checkpoint saving logic to use new functionality
4. Created test file test_model_saving.py to verify all saving/loading functionality

All implementations are tested and confirmed working, supporting both PyTorch native format and ONNX format for different use cases.

## 2. Saving optimizer state [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement functionality to save the optimizer's state (e.g., momentum buffers, learning rate schedules).
### Details:
The optimizer state must be saved alongside the model state to ensure training can resume accurately.
<info added on 2025-05-11T02:29:45.928Z>
The optimizer state must be saved alongside the model state to ensure training can resume accurately. Completed implementation includes enhancements to OptimizerManager.state_dict() and OptimizerManager.load_state_dict() for comprehensive state handling, error recovery, and metadata inclusion. Updated model_utils.py with timestamp and optimizer metadata in save_checkpoint(), and added validation in load_checkpoint(). Created test_optimizer_saving.py for thorough testing across optimizer types (SGD, Adam, AdamW) and scheduler states. Added optimizer-specific test cases in test_model_saving.py. All tests passed, confirming accurate state preservation and recovery for interrupted training resumption.

## 3. Adding ONNX export support [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement functionality to export the model to the ONNX format for interoperability with other frameworks.
### Details:
Ensure the exported ONNX model retains all necessary operations and is compatible with target inference environments.
<info added on 2025-05-11T03:16:40.279Z>
Enhanced the export_to_onnx function in model_utils.py with new features: model verification (verify parameter), ONNX model simplification (simplify parameter), ONNX model optimization (optimize parameter), and target inference environment configuration (target_providers parameter). Implemented new ONNX-related functions: simplify_onnx_model, optimize_onnx_model, verify_onnx_model, load_onnx_model, onnx_inference, and get_onnx_model_info. Updated VisionTransformer's export_to_onnx method to support new parameters and features. Updated model module's __init__.py to export new ONNX functions. Created scripts/demo_onnx_export.py for demonstration and docs/onnx_export.md for documentation. Enhanced testing with updates to test_model_saving.py and new test cases test_onnx_inference and test_onnx_model_info. Updated fileStructure.md with ONNX-related file descriptions. All functionalities tested and verified, with performance improvements in certain scenarios.
