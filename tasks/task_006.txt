# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Model Saving Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable saving and loading trained models.
# Details:
Implement functions to save the model state and optimizer state. Support saving in PyTorch format and provide options for exporting to ONNX.

# Test Strategy:
Save a model after training and verify it can be loaded and used for inference.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Saving model state [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to save the model's state (weights, architecture, etc.) in a compatible format.
### Details:
Ensure the saved state includes all necessary components for reloading the model correctly, such as layer weights and configurations.

## 2. Saving optimizer state [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement functionality to save the optimizer's state (e.g., momentum buffers, learning rate schedules).
### Details:
The optimizer state must be saved alongside the model state to ensure training can resume accurately.

## 3. Adding ONNX export support [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement functionality to export the model to the ONNX format for interoperability with other frameworks.
### Details:
Ensure the exported ONNX model retains all necessary operations and is compatible with target inference environments.
