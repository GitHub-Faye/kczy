# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Performance Metrics Recording
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up comprehensive logging for training and test metrics with visualization capabilities.
# Details:
Implement functionality to record, store, analyze and visualize loss, accuracy and other metrics during training and evaluation. Support flexible configuration and provide various output formats (CSV/JSON) with visualization options.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all metric recording, storage, retrieval, visualization and analysis features work correctly through unit tests and simulated training sessions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Recording training metrics [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement functionality to record training metrics such as loss, accuracy, and other relevant performance indicators during the training process.
### Details:
Ensure metrics are captured at specified intervals (e.g., per epoch or batch) and stored temporarily for further processing.
<info added on 2025-05-09T12:05:21.046Z>
Implementation plan for training metrics recording:
1. Create a new `MetricsLogger` class in `src/utils/metrics_logger.py` to handle logging, saving, and loading of training/evaluation metrics in CSV and JSON formats.
2. Integrate `MetricsLogger` into the existing `TrainingLoop` class in `src/models/train.py` to enable automatic metric recording during training.
3. Enhance `TrainingLoop.train` method to support metric saving functionality, calling logging methods at key points (e.g., after each epoch).
4. Ensure metrics include timestamps for analysis and maintain consistent data format.
5. Provide flexible configuration options (save frequency, format selection) without disrupting existing training flow.
6. Add utility methods for loading saved metrics and generating visualizations.

## 2. Saving metrics to structured format [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Convert the recorded metrics into structured formats (JSON, CSV) with comprehensive storage and retrieval capabilities.
### Details:
Implement advanced storage features including:
- Flexible configuration of save directory, experiment name and format
- Automatic directory creation
- Multiple save formats (CSV/JSON)
- Methods for loading training/evaluation metrics
- Consolidated export of all metrics to single file

<info added on 2025-05-10T00:18:15.207Z>
Implemented functionality to save metrics in structured formats (JSON and CSV) within the `MetricsLogger` class. Methods include `_save_json()` and `_save_csv()` for saving metrics with epoch, value, and timestamp. Auto-save feature triggers at specified intervals, saving training metrics as `{experiment_name}_train_metrics.{format}` and evaluation metrics as `{experiment_name}_eval_metrics.{format}`. Loading functions (`load_train_metrics()`, `load_eval_metrics()`) support retrieval from saved files, with internal `_load_json()` and `_load_csv()` methods. Added `export_metrics()` to consolidate all metrics into a single file. Standardized data structures ensure consistency and readability, with tested save/load functionality.

## 3. Implement visualization and analysis features [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Add comprehensive visualization and analysis capabilities for recorded metrics.
### Details:
Implement the following visualization and analysis features:
- plot_metric(): Draw single metric curves
- plot_metrics(): Draw multiple metric comparisons
- summary(): Generate statistical summaries
- visualize_all_metrics(): Create comprehensive reports
- get_best_epoch(): Identify optimal model performance

Integrate these features with the existing MetricsLogger class and ensure they work with both CSV and JSON formats.

## 4. Complete system integration [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Fully integrate metrics recording into the training pipeline with configuration support.
### Details:
Final integration tasks:
1. Update TrainingConfig class with metrics recording parameters
2. Complete integration of MetricsLogger into TrainingLoop
3. Implement automatic visualization generation post-training
4. Ensure all configuration options are properly exposed
5. Verify end-to-end functionality through simulated training

## 5. Comprehensive testing and validation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Verify all metric recording, storage, visualization and analysis features.
### Details:
Testing strategy:
1. Expand existing test suite with visualization and analysis tests
2. Add integration tests for full training pipeline
3. Verify configuration options work as expected
4. Test edge cases (empty metrics, invalid formats, etc.)
5. Perform manual verification through simulated training sessions

<info added on 2025-05-10T00:19:07.457Z>
Completed metric recording verification work:
1. Created comprehensive unit test file `tests/test_metrics_logger.py` with the following tests:
   - `test_init`: Verify `MetricsLogger` initialization correctly sets instance properties and file paths
   - `test_log_train_metrics`: Verify training metric logging functionality
   - `test_log_eval_metrics`: Verify evaluation metric logging functionality
   - `test_save_load_csv`: Verify CSV format saving and loading
   - `test_save_load_json`: Verify JSON format saving and loading
   - `test_plot_metric`: Verify metric visualization
   - `test_summary`: Verify metric summary generation

2. Implemented `simulate_training()` function for manual testing, simulating a full training process:
   - Simulated 50 training epochs
   - Recorded loss, accuracy, learning rate, and other metrics
   - Generated visualizations
   - Produced summary reports

3. Test results confirmed:
   - All 7 unit test cases passed
   - Simulated training successfully recorded all metrics
   - Visualizations were generated correctly
   - Metric summaries displayed expected statistical results

Testing confirms the `MetricsLogger` class accurately records, saves, loads, and visualizes training/evaluation metrics, meeting task requirements.
