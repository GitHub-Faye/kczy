# Task ID: 11
# Title: Train and Evaluate Model with Data Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Load, preprocess, and train a model using the dataset in the data directory, then evaluate and visualize the entire process.
# Details:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset from the data directory, ensuring proper normalization and splitting into training/validation sets. 2. Configure training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs, and set up logging for the training process. 3. Train the model while recording metrics like loss and accuracy. 4. Evaluate the model on a test set to measure performance metrics. 5. Use visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, TensorBoard) to plot training curves, evaluation results, and sample model outputs.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify dataset loading and preprocessing by checking the shape and distribution of the data. 2. Confirm training configuration by logging and reviewing the parameters. 3. Validate training by monitoring loss/accuracy trends and ensuring they are logged. 4. Test evaluation by comparing model predictions against ground truth labels. 5. Check visualizations for correctness and clarity, ensuring they accurately represent the training and evaluation data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Load and Preprocess Dataset [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Load the dataset from the data directory, perform preprocessing steps including normalization, and split into training/validation sets.
### Details:
Ensure the dataset is properly loaded, normalized, and split into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets.

## 2. Configure Training Parameters [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Set up training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, epochs, and logging for the training process.
### Details:
Define hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate=0.001, batch size=32, epochs=50) and configure logging (e.g., TensorBoard).

## 3. Train the Model [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Train the model while recording metrics like loss and accuracy for both training and validation sets.
### Details:
Execute the training loop, log metrics at each epoch, and save model checkpoints.

## 4. Evaluate Model Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Evaluate the trained model on the test set to measure performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
### Details:
Run inference on the test set, compute metrics, and generate a classification report.

## 5. Visualize Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Use visualization tools to plot training curves, evaluation results, and sample model outputs.
### Details:
Generate plots (e.g., loss/accuracy curves, confusion matrix) using Matplotlib or TensorBoard.
