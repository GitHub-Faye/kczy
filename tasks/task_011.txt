# Task ID: 11
# Title: Train and Evaluate Model with Data Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Load, preprocess, and train a model using the dataset in the data directory, then evaluate and visualize the entire process.
# Details:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset from the data directory, ensuring proper normalization and splitting into training/validation sets. 2. Configure training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs, and set up logging for the training process. 3. Train the model while recording metrics like loss and accuracy. 4. Evaluate the model on a test set to measure performance metrics. 5. Use visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, TensorBoard) to plot training curves, evaluation results, and sample model outputs.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify dataset loading and preprocessing by checking the shape and distribution of the data. 2. Confirm training configuration by logging and reviewing the parameters. 3. Validate training by monitoring loss/accuracy trends and ensuring they are logged. 4. Test evaluation by comparing model predictions against ground truth labels. 5. Check visualizations for correctness and clarity, ensuring they accurately represent the training and evaluation data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Load and Preprocess Dataset [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Load the dataset from the data directory, perform preprocessing steps including normalization, and split into training/validation sets.
### Details:
Ensure the dataset is properly loaded, normalized, and split into training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) sets.

Implementation completed with the following features: 1. Enhanced data loading function create_dataloaders to support training (70%), validation (20%), and test (10%) dataset splits. 2. Updated create_dataloaders_from_config to support three-way dataset splits. 3. Added verify_dataset_splits function to validate split ratios. 4. Added normalize_image and denormalize_image functions for image normalization. 5. Created demo_data_loader.py to demonstrate new data loading features. 6. Conducted comprehensive testing to verify: default 70%/20%/10% splits, config-based loader creation, error handling for invalid splits, image normalization/denormalization, and command-line control over split ratios. All features tested and validated.

## 2. Configure Training Parameters [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Set up training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, epochs, and logging for the training process.
### Details:
Define hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate=0.001, batch size=32, epochs=50) and configure logging (e.g., TensorBoard).
<info added on 2025-05-13T07:19:28.855Z>
Implemented comprehensive training parameter configuration management in `src/models/train_config.py` with functions for creating, validating, printing, saving, and loading training configurations. Added TensorBoard setup and device-specific optimal configuration generation. Created demo scripts and updated `TrainingLoop.from_config()` to include validation, logging, and TensorBoard integration. Enhanced model checkpoint saving to include training configurations. Conducted thorough testing with `tests/test_train_config.py` and `scripts/run_config_tests.py`, ensuring full coverage of functionality. All implementations adhere to project structure standards and include CLI, configuration file, and predefined configuration support.

## 3. Train the Model [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Train the model while recording metrics like loss and accuracy for both training and validation sets.
### Details:
Execute the training loop, log metrics at each epoch, and save model checkpoints.
<info added on 2025-05-13T08:34:59.265Z>
Execute the training loop, log metrics at each epoch, and save model checkpoints. Completed testing for subtask 11.3 with all tests passing. Fixed issues including: 1) Changed VisionTransformer initialization parameter from dropout_rate to drop_rate, 2) Corrected early_stopping_count variable naming in TrainingLoop.train to patience_counter, 3) Updated test code to match actual training history structure, 4) Fixed OptimizerManager initialization to use constructor instead of non-existent from_config method. Demo script successfully runs, showcasing full training workflow including model training/validation, loss/accuracy logging, checkpoint save/load, TensorBoard visualization, early stopping, and training history saving.

## 4. Evaluate Model Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Evaluate the trained model on the test set to measure performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
### Details:
Run inference on the test set, compute metrics, and generate a classification report.

## 5. Visualize Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Use visualization tools to plot training curves, evaluation results, and sample model outputs.
### Details:
Generate plots (e.g., loss/accuracy curves, confusion matrix) using Matplotlib or TensorBoard.
