# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Command-Line Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a CLI for configuring and launching training.
# Details:
Use argparse to create a command-line interface for setting hyperparameters, specifying datasets, and starting training. Include help messages and default values.

# Test Strategy:
Test the CLI with various arguments to ensure correct configuration and training launch.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setting up argparse [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the argparse module to handle command-line arguments.
### Details:
Create a basic argparse setup including the parser object and basic configurations like description and help messages.

Completed basic argparse setup with the following implementations:
1. Created `src/utils/cli.py` with functions: `create_parser()` for parser configuration, `parse_args()` for argument parsing, `load_config()` for config file loading, and `print_args_info()` for argument display.
2. Updated `src/utils/__init__.py` to export CLI functions.
3. Developed test tools: `scripts/test_cli.py` for CLI testing and `scripts/example_config.json` as a sample config file.
4. Created an example entry script `scripts/train.py` demonstrating CLI usage with parameter parsing, config creation, and environment setup.

Parameters are organized into groups: general, dataset, model, training, logging, and checkpoint. CLI arguments integrate with the existing config system, allowing config file parameters to be overridden by command-line arguments. Testing confirmed proper functionality, laying the groundwork for subsequent tasks 8.2 (hyperparameters), 8.3 (dataset specifications), and 8.4 (CLI testing).

## 2. Adding hyperparameter arguments [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Add arguments for hyperparameters to the CLI.
### Details:
Define hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs as command-line arguments with appropriate types and default values.

## 3. Adding dataset specification [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Add arguments to specify the dataset and related configurations.
### Details:
Include arguments for dataset paths, splits (train/validation/test), and any dataset-specific parameters like augmentation options.

## 4. Testing CLI with various arguments [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Test the CLI with different combinations of arguments to ensure correctness.
### Details:
Run the CLI with various argument combinations, including edge cases, to verify that all arguments are parsed correctly and the program behaves as expected.
