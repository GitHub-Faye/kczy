# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Model Structure Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Add tools to visualize the ViT model architecture.
# Details:
Develop functions to visualize the model's attention weights and layer connections. Use matplotlib or similar libraries to generate static visualizations.

# Test Strategy:
Generate visualizations for a trained model and verify they accurately represent the model structure.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Visualizing attention weights [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create visualizations to represent the attention weights of the model, showing how different parts of the input are weighted during processing.
### Details:
Implement code to extract attention weights from the model and generate heatmaps or other visual representations.

## 2. Plotting layer connections [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Generate diagrams or graphs that illustrate the connections between different layers of the model.
### Details:
Use tools like Graphviz or matplotlib to create visualizations of the model's architecture, showing how layers are interconnected.

## 3. Generating static visualizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Produce static images or plots that summarize the model's structure and behavior for documentation or analysis.
### Details:
Combine the attention weight and layer connection visualizations into a cohesive set of static images, ensuring clarity and accuracy.

## 4. Testing with trained model [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Validate the visualizations by applying them to a trained model and verifying their accuracy and usefulness.
### Details:
Run the visualization tools on a trained model instance, check for correctness, and refine the visualizations based on feedback.
