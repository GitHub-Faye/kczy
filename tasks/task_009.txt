# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance Visualization with TensorBoard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Add TensorBoard support for real-time training monitoring.
# Details:
Integrate TensorBoard to log metrics during training. Provide options to start TensorBoard from the CLI and view training progress in a web interface.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that TensorBoard logs are created and can be viewed in the web interface during training.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrating TensorBoard logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement TensorBoard logging in the codebase to capture and log training metrics.
### Details:
Modify the training loop to log metrics such as loss, accuracy, and other relevant statistics to TensorBoard.

## 2. Adding CLI options for TensorBoard [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Extend the command-line interface to include options for TensorBoard configuration.
### Details:
Add CLI arguments to specify log directory, port, and other TensorBoard-related settings.

## 3. Starting TensorBoard from CLI [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement functionality to start TensorBoard from the command-line interface.
### Details:
Ensure the CLI can launch TensorBoard with the specified configurations and log directory.

## 4. Verifying web interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Test the TensorBoard web interface to ensure metrics are displayed correctly.
### Details:
Access the TensorBoard web interface and verify that all logged metrics are visible and updating in real-time.
