# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance Visualization with TensorBoard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Add TensorBoard support for real-time training monitoring.
# Details:
Integrate TensorBoard to log metrics during training. Provide options to start TensorBoard from the CLI and view training progress in a web interface.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that TensorBoard logs are created and can be viewed in the web interface during training.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrating TensorBoard logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement TensorBoard logging in the codebase to capture and log training metrics.
### Details:
Modify the training loop to log metrics such as loss, accuracy, and other relevant statistics to TensorBoard.

Successfully integrated TensorBoard logging with the following key implementations: 1) Added TensorBoard support in MetricsLogger class with enable_tensorboard and tensorboard_log_dir parameters, and implemented methods like log_histogram, log_image, log_figure, and log_hparams. 2) Enhanced TrainingConfig class with TensorBoard-specific options including enable_tensorboard, tensorboard_dir, log_histograms, and log_images. 3) Modified TrainingLoop to log detailed metrics, model parameters, gradients histograms, sample images, and hyperparameters, ensuring proper closure of the TensorBoard writer. 4) Created and executed a test script (test_tensorboard.py) to validate TensorBoard functionality, confirming successful log generation and visualization at http://localhost:6006. This integration enables real-time training monitoring, parameter visualization, and experiment tracking, significantly improving model debugging and optimization efficiency.

## 2. Adding CLI options for TensorBoard [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Extend the command-line interface to include options for TensorBoard configuration.
### Details:
Add CLI arguments to specify log directory, port, and other TensorBoard-related settings.
<info added on 2025-05-11T12:56:52.274Z>
Successfully implemented CLI support for TensorBoard configuration. Key accomplishments include: 1. Added TensorBoard argument group to the command-line parser, including options like --enable-tensorboard, --tensorboard-dir, --tensorboard-port, --log-histograms, and --log-images. 2. Added tensorboard_port field to the TrainingConfig class with port validation. 3. Fixed logic in parse_args function to ensure correct loading of boolean and string parameters from config files, with CLI arguments taking precedence. 4. Added support for printing TensorBoard arguments in print_args_info. 5. Wrote comprehensive unit tests (test_tensorboard_cli.py) to verify all functionality. These changes enable users to conveniently control TensorBoard behavior via CLI or config files, laying the groundwork for subtask 9.3 (Starting TensorBoard from CLI).

## 3. Starting TensorBoard from CLI [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement functionality to start TensorBoard from the command-line interface.
### Details:
Ensure the CLI can launch TensorBoard with the specified configurations and log directory.
<info added on 2025-05-11T15:12:48.881Z>
Implementation completed with the following key components:
1. Created src/utils/tensorboard_utils.py module with functions for port checking, TensorBoard process management, and executable path resolution.
2. Added CLI parameters (--start-tensorboard, --tensorboard-host, --tensorboard-background) to control TensorBoard server behavior.
3. Enhanced TrainingConfig class to support new TensorBoard parameters.
4. Integrated TensorBoard startup logic into scripts/train.py and created standalone scripts/start_tensorboard.py.
5. Developed comprehensive tests in tests/test_tensorboard_utils.py covering all functionality.

TensorBoard can now be started via:
- Training script with --start-tensorboard flag
- Dedicated start_tensorboard.py script
- Direct calls to tensorboard_utils functions

## 4. Verifying web interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Test the TensorBoard web interface to ensure metrics are displayed correctly.
### Details:
Access the TensorBoard web interface and verify that all logged metrics are visible and updating in real-time.
