# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with necessary structure and dependencies.
# Details:
Create a new Python project with a virtual environment. Install PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy, and pandas. Set up a basic directory structure for source code, data, and models.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the environment setup by running a simple PyTorch script to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Creating the virtual environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
### Details:
Use a tool like `venv` or `conda` to create a new virtual environment for the project.

## 2. Installing core dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install the necessary Python packages and libraries required for the project.
### Details:
Use `pip` or `conda` to install dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` file.

## 3. Setting up directory structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Organize the project files into a logical directory structure.
### Details:
Create directories such as `src`, `tests`, `docs`, and `data` to organize the project files.

## 4. Verifying the setup with a test script [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Run a simple test script to ensure the environment and dependencies are correctly configured.
### Details:
Write and execute a basic script (e.g., `test.py`) to confirm that the setup works as expected.
