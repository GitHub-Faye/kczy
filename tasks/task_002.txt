# Subtasks:
## 1. Creating the base data loader class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a foundational data loader class capable of loading raw data from a specified source.
### Details:
The base class should handle basic file operations and provide a structure for derived classes to implement specific data loading logic.

## 2. Implementing preprocessing transforms [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add preprocessing functionality to the data loader to clean and normalize raw data.
### Details:
Include methods for common preprocessing tasks such as scaling, normalization, and handling missing values.

Implementation plan for preprocessing transforms:
1. Create a new file src/data/preprocessing.py to implement data preprocessing functions including normalization/standardization, missing value handling, data scaling, and outlier detection/processing.
2. Current code observations:
   - BaseDataset class exists in dataset.py for loading images and annotations.
   - Basic transformation functionality is present in data_loader.py, primarily for image augmentation and basic preprocessing.
   - Additional specialized data cleaning and preprocessing functions are needed.
3. Implement the following in preprocessing.py:
   - Data standardization functions.
   - Methods for filling missing values.
   - Data scalers.
   - Outlier detection and processing.
   - Preprocessing pipelines for different data types.
4. Update __init__.py to export new preprocessing functionalities, making them accessible via the src.data.preprocessing module.

## 4. Supporting custom datasets [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Enable the data loader to work with user-defined datasets by providing flexible configuration options.
### Details:
Allow users to specify custom data paths, formats, and preprocessing/augmentation settings via configuration files or parameters.
<info added on 2025-05-07T06:53:08.397Z>
Allow users to specify custom data paths, formats, and preprocessing/augmentation settings via configuration files or parameters. Implementation plan: 1. Create a `DatasetConfig` class in `src/data/config.py` to store and validate user-defined dataset parameters. 2. Extend `data_loader.py` to support creating data loaders from configuration objects. 3. Add configuration file read/write functionality supporting JSON or YAML formats. 4. Provide an example configuration template to demonstrate usage.

## 5. Testing with sample data [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Validate the data loader's functionality by testing it with a variety of sample datasets.
### Details:
Create test cases to verify data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and custom dataset support, ensuring robustness and correctness.

Create test cases to verify data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and custom dataset support, ensuring robustness and correctness. Test Strategy: 1. Test Case Design: - Unit tests for individual data loading functions (e.g., CSV, JSON, image loading). - Integration tests for preprocessing pipelines (normalization, resizing, etc.). - End-to-end tests for full data flow from loading to augmentation. - Edge cases: empty datasets, malformed files, large datasets. 2. Test Data Preparation: - Use diverse sample datasets (structured, unstructured, small/large files). - Include synthetic datasets to simulate edge cases. - Ensure datasets cover all supported formats and custom dataset configurations. 3. Verification Methods: - Compare loaded data against expected outputs (checksums, metadata). - Validate preprocessing results using reference implementations. - Test augmentation by visually inspecting samples or using metrics. - For custom datasets, verify compatibility and correct parsing. 4. Testing Frameworks: - pytest for Python-based unit and integration tests. - unittest for framework-agnostic test cases. - CI/CD pipelines for automated testing (e.g., GitHub Actions). - Performance testing tools (e.g., Locust) for large dataset handling.

Focus on verifying the successful loading and processing of datasets in the project's 'data' folder. Testing will specifically ensure: 1. Correct reading of 'annotations.csv' file. 2. Proper loading of image files from the 'images' directory. 3. Accurate association of CSV annotation data with corresponding images. 4. Correct handling of sample data in 'data/examples' directory. Test Strategy: - Write simple test scripts to verify data loading. - Confirm all data formats (CSV, images) are parsed correctly. - Validate the data loader's ability to process the project's built-in datasets. - Skip complex performance testing; focus on basic functional verification.
