# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Basic Visualization Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop simple tools to visualize training metrics.
# Details:
Use matplotlib to generate static plots of loss and accuracy over time. Provide functions to save plots to files.

# Test Strategy:
Generate plots from recorded metrics and verify they accurately represent the training progress.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Plotting loss over time [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a plot showing the loss values over the training epochs.
### Details:
Use the recorded loss values from each epoch to generate a line plot. Ensure the plot has appropriate labels for the x-axis (epochs) and y-axis (loss).

## 2. Plotting accuracy over time [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a plot showing the accuracy values over the training epochs.
### Details:
Use the recorded accuracy values from each epoch to generate a line plot. Ensure the plot has appropriate labels for the x-axis (epochs) and y-axis (accuracy).

## 3. Saving plots to files [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Save the generated loss and accuracy plots to files.
### Details:
Save the plots created in subtasks 1 and 2 to image files (e.g., PNG or JPEG format) in a specified directory. Ensure the filenames are descriptive and include timestamps if necessary.
