# Task ID: 7
# Title: Create Basic Visualization Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop simple tools to visualize training metrics.
# Details:
Use matplotlib to generate static plots of loss and accuracy over time. Provide functions to save plots to files.

# Test Strategy:
Generate plots from recorded metrics and verify they accurately represent the training progress.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Plotting loss over time [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a plot showing the loss values over the training epochs.
### Details:
Use the recorded loss values from each epoch to generate a line plot. Ensure the plot has appropriate labels for the x-axis (epochs) and y-axis (loss).

The task 'Plotting loss over time' has been completed with the following implementations:
1. Created directory structure 'src/visualization' with '__init__.py' and 'metrics_plots.py' files.
2. Implemented two main functions in 'metrics_plots.py':
   - 'plot_loss()': Specifically for plotting loss curves, supporting data loading from files or MetricsLogger instances.
   - 'plot_training_history()': Capable of plotting various metric curves, including loss and accuracy.

Key features:
- Supports loading data from CSV and JSON metric files.
- Direct usage of MetricsLogger instances.
- Rich customization options: chart size, title, grid display, DPI, etc.
- Supports display or saving to a specified path.
- Created a complete test script 'scripts/test_loss_plot.py' to verify all functionalities.
- Comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Detailed documentation and example code.

Test results:
- Successfully generated loss curves from CSV files.
- Successfully generated loss curves from MetricsLogger instances.
- Successfully generated curves for multiple metrics.

Output file paths:
- 'temp_metrics/plots/loss_curve.png'
- 'temp_metrics/plots/loss_curve_test1.png'
- 'temp_metrics/plots/loss_curve_test2.png'

## 2. Plotting accuracy over time [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a plot showing the accuracy values over the training epochs.
### Details:
Use the recorded accuracy values from each epoch to generate a line plot. Ensure the plot has appropriate labels for the x-axis (epochs) and y-axis (accuracy).

## 3. Saving plots to files [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Save the generated loss and accuracy plots to files.
### Details:
Save the plots created in subtasks 1 and 2 to image files (e.g., PNG or JPEG format) in a specified directory. Ensure the filenames are descriptive and include timestamps if necessary.
